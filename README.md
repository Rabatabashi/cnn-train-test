# CNNTrainingFromScratch
The project created for to understand better that how a simple convolutional neural network works. In this project we doesn't use any training framework like TensorFlow or Caffe, only use numpy for the computations. You can test an MNIST training with the main.py.

The repository MANIFEST:
 - **resources**: contains all the resource files
 - **resources/dataset**: contains all the test datasets (MNIST)
 - **scripts**: contains all the implemented scripts
 - **scripts/tools**: helper scripts, like Python virtualenv creator
 - **scripts/train**: the CNN classes, and main entry point scripts
